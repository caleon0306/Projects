# Description

This a personal project where I incorporated many designs and skills I have learned from my classes

The Problem(s): A weekly trip to the grocery store can take a while, especially if you are running around back and forth between isles.
Another issue is deciding what meals you want to eat and getting all of the ingredients written down.

(Disclaimer) the program is not 100% finished
The Spring 2024 semester started and I have allocated my time to the ongoing semester
The main part that is missing is adding meals through the program, rather than typing directly to .txt
I would solve this part similarly to creating an ingredient

The solution: This program aims to solve both problems mentioned above.
The program allows the user to add, remove, and view meals in their cart.
(The sorting mentioned below talks about a single store near my house
I looked up the items in the store and the store had a map with their coordiantes in the store
Each item was then given a value based on where the store said it was located)
Once the user is done they can finish the program and it will make a sorted list of all of their items
The sorted list is outputed to the screen in order based on which items are first
